astral/iqtree is algorithm

rXX = threshold for removing specimen's sequence based on proportion exon recovered. r10 removes loci with 10% or less exon recovered from dataset

lXX = thresold for removing locus based on locus recovery length. 

iXX = threshold for removing loci based on number of individuals. 

l50_i50 means that only loci with 50% of the exon recovered in 50% of individuals are kept.

_auto_, _ginsi_ etc indicates MAFFT alignment algorithm. exons is when exon alignment rather than supercontigs are used.

b2_0, b2_d is how conservative GBLOCKS deals with gap characters
